                                  SUMMARY
================================================================================

Uddit is a dual-degree student combining materials engineering (MNIT) with data
science (IIT Madras), but his real focus is building production-ready enterprise
software. His strength lies in rapid full-stack development with AI/ML
integration — going from concept to deployed platform in record time. He has
carved out a niche in building scalable systems that actually serve real users
and solve real business problems.

================================================================================
                      INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY & PATENT EXPERIENCE
================================================================================

Over the past year, Uddit transitioned into the intellectual property space,
working with legal and IP firms including:

• Invent IP Legal Services LLP
• Sitabience IP
• Mainland IP

His role involved contributing to patent drafting and prosecution for
cutting-edge technologies — specifically in areas like:

• Docker containerization
• Kubernetes orchestration
• Kata containers
• Broader container security architectures

He wasn't the sole inventor; he worked as part of technical teams responsible
for:

• Researching prior art
• Understanding the inventive claims
• Drafting technically accurate patent specifications that could withstand
  examination

This experience gave him deep exposure to how AI/ML innovations are protected
legally and how to articulate novel technical contributions in patent language.

Alongside this, he built practical skills in AI engineering:

• Fine-tuning large language models (including LoRA-based approaches)
• Designing RAG pipelines (both traditional retrieval-based and agentic
  architectures)
• Working with vector databases like Pinecone and ChromaDB

He also contributed to building AI-powered tools for patent drafting and
prosecution workflows, combining his full-stack development background with
domain knowledge in IP.

This intersection of patent law and AI engineering has given him a unique
perspective on both building and protecting technical innovations.
